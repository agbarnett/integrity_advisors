## Flow diagram

```{r, include=FALSE}
load('results/3_estimate_national.RData') # from 3_estimate_national_numbers.R
load('rdata/flow_numbers.RData') # from 1_consort_diagram.R
```

The diagram below shows how we first approached institutions and then advisors. 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=6}
# figure from '1_consort_diagram.R'
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/consort_flow.jpg')
# for text below
percent_behalf = filter(response_frame, type=='Behalf') %>% pull(p)
percent_direct = filter(response_frame, type=='Direct') %>% pull(p)
percent_overall = filter(response_frame, type=='Total') %>% pull(p)
```

Most institutions (N = `r not_contactable + not_available`) did not make the contact details of their Research Integrity Advisors publicly available. One institution had a separate approvals process for conducting research, and we were not able to complete this process.

## Number of research integrity advisors

The bar plot below shows the number of advisors from the `r known` institutions where this information was publicly available or that provided it on request.
The modal number of advisors was 1, the median was `r median(numbers$n)` and the maximum `r max(numbers$n)`. The first to third quartile was `r quantile(numbers$n, 0.25)` to `r quantile(numbers$n, 0.75)`. The between-institution variation in advisor numbers is large.

```{r}
bplot = ggplot(data = numbers, aes(x=n))+
  geom_bar(fill='dark orange', col='grey66')+
  g.theme+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1,10,20,30,40), expand = c(0.01,0.01))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,2))+ # avoid fractions
  xlab('Number of research integrity advisors')+
  ylab('Number of institutions')
bplot
ggsave(filename = 'figures/numbers_bar.jpg', plot= bplot, width=5, height=4, units='in', dpi=500)
```

We used a bootstrap approach to estimate the total national number of advisors and the uncertainty in this estimate. 
We randomly imputed the number of RIAs for the `r unknown` institutions where we did not know the number of advisors, based on the observed numbers shown above. We then calculated the total number of advisors using the observed and imputed numbers. We repeated this imputation and calculation 1,000 times. The plot below shows the 1,000 bootstrap estimates of the national total.

```{r}
# get the estimates from 3_estimate_national_numbers.R
hplot = ggplot(data = all_boot, aes(x = total))+
  geom_histogram(fill='goldenrod1', col = 'grey66')+
  g.theme+
  ylab('Count')+
  xlab('National number of advisors')
hplot
```

The estimated median number of national advisors is `r median(all_boot$total)` with 1st quartile of `r quantile(all_boot$total, 0.25)` and 3rd quartile of `r quantile(all_boot$total, 0.75)`. A 95% bootstrap interval is `r quantile(all_boot$total, 0.025)` to `r quantile(all_boot$total, 0.975)`.

## Questionnaire

The total number of responses was `r nrow(data)`.
The overall response percentage was `r percent_overall`% with `r rias_responded` responses from `r rias_with_email` emails. The response percentage from the direct invite from our team was `r percent_direct`%, whereas the response percentage from the five institutions that passed on our invite was much lower at `r percent_behalf`%.

Text _in italics_ below is the wording used in the questionnaire.

## _I consent to participate._

```{r}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q1_2", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
# remainder of results is only for those who consented
data = filter(data, !str_detect(q1_2,'No'))
```

The results below exclude the participant who did not consent.

## _I am a current Research Integrity Advisor and/or was a Research Integrity Advisor this time last year._

```{r}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q1_3", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
# save for later
plot_current = results$plot
# remainder of results is only for RIAs
data = filter(data, str_detect(q1_3,'Yes'))
```

The results below exclude the participants who were not research integrity advisors.

## _When did you role as a Research Integrity Advisor start?_ 

Respondents were asked to give their start year and date. There were `r sum(is.na(data$yrmon_start))` missing responses. The earliest year in the questionnaire was 2016, but this was an error as the policy started before then. A number of respondents gave their starting year as an optional comment. 

```{r start}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "yrmon_start", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     digits = 1, 
                     type = 'continuous', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
#
```

## _Are you still a Research Integrity Advisor?_ 

```{r still}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = TRUE, 
                     label = "q2_2", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
```

## Number of years in role

```{r}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "years_in_role", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'continuous', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
```


#### Boxplot

The results are split by those who have left the role and those ongoing.

```{r}
# convert months to years
to_plot = filter(data, !is.na(q2_2)) # exclude missing
bplot = ggplot(data = to_plot, aes(x = q2_2, y = years_in_role)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  g.theme+
  xlab('Current Research Integrity Advisor')+
  ylab('Years in role')

```


# Training and workload

## _Have you received training for your role as a Research Integrity Advisor?_

### Initial training when starting the role

```{r}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q3_1_1", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
# make bootstrap confidence interval for percent
source('4_training_with_uncertainty.R')
# save for later
plot_training1 = results$plot
```

### Ongoing training during the role

```{r}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q3_1_2", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
# save for later
plot_training2 = results$plot
```

### Cross-tabulation of initial and ongoing training


```{r}
tab = tabyl(data, q3_1_1, q3_1_2) %>% 
  adorn_percentages("all") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0) %>%
  adorn_ns(position = 'front') %>%
  rename('Missing' = 'NA_') %>%
  mutate(q3_1_1 = ifelse(is.na(q3_1_1), 'Missing', q3_1_1))
names(tab)[1] = 'Initial training'
ftab = flextable(tab) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit() %>%
  add_header_row(values=c('','Ongoing training','Ongoing training','Ongoing training')) %>%
  merge_h(part='header')
ftab
```

Thirteen percent of respondents did not receive initial or ongoing training.

## _In your opinion, has the amount of training for your role as a Research Integrity Advisory been ... _

```{r training_amount}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = TRUE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q3_2", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table

# save for later
plot_training_amount = results$plot
```


## _How much time have you spent in your role as a Research Integrity Advisor? Include the time spent providing advice, attending meetings, reading policies/guidelines, giving presentations and attending courses._ 

```{r}
#
n_resp = filter(data, !is.na(q3_3)) %>% # 
  select(id) %>%
  unique() %>%
  nrow()
#
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q3_3", 
                     digits = 1,
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'continuous', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
# for text
zero_time = sum(data$q3_3==0, na.rm=TRUE)
zero_time_percent = round(100*zero_time / sum(is.na(data$q3_3)==FALSE))
```

This is the number of days per month that the respondents work in their advisory role. We asked respondents to give an estimate of the average number of days per month spent giving advice. Respondents were also able to answer in terms of working days or full-time equivalent, and these estimates were converted to the monthly average.

#### Histogram

```{r}
# made an inset because of the strong skew in the plot (grey66 to match previous)
inset = ggplot(data = data, aes(x=q3_3)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = sample_colours[1], col='grey66', binwidth=0.2)+ 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,2))+ # truncate
  xlab('')+
  ylab('Count')+
  g.theme
plot_inset = results$plot + 
  annotation_custom(
    ggplotGrob(inset), 
    xmin = 5, xmax = 21, ymin = 12, ymax = 70
  )
plot_inset
# export
ggsave(filename = 'figures/advisors_time.jpg', plot= plot_inset, width=5, height=4, units='in', dpi=500)
```

There was a strong positive skew in the time as a few respondents indicated that all or most of their time is spent as an advisor. To examine the majority of responses in more detail, we used an inset plot that was truncated at 2 days. The inset shows a relatively large number of responses of 1 day per month. 

The number of advisors reporting no time was `r zero_time` (`r zero_time_percent`%).

#### Average time

Here we estimate the average time spent in the role and account for uncertainty from non-responders and the uncertainty given by some respondents, e.g. "2 to 4 days".

```{r}
source('4_time_with_uncertainty.R') # 
stats = calc_stats(indata = results, mult = 10)
ftab = flextable(stats) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

The table shows the estimated mean and median with the uncertainty (lower to upper 95% confidence interval). The mean is relatively high compared to the median because of the large outliers. Both estimates are still a small amount of time. It also shows the estimated percent who have spent no time.


### Time spent in role - answer option

```{r}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q3_3_option", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
```

The table shows which of the three options was most often used to estimate their time spent in the role. FTE = full-time equivalent. The "Days" answer is their total working days.

### Time spent in role - uncertainty

```{r}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q3_3_uncertainty", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
```

The table shows the number of respondents who indicated some uncertainty in their time spent in the role.

## _In your role as a Research Integrity Advisor, how many times have you provided advice for staff and students?_

#### Staff (average per month)

```{r}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q4_1_s", 
                     digits = 1,
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'continuous', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
# for text
text = sum(data$q4_1_s == 0, na.rm = TRUE)
percent = round(100*text/nrow(data))
```

There were `r text` (`r percent`%) respondents who said they had not provided any help to staff.

##### Histogram

```{r}
# make an inset because of the strong skew in the plot
inset = ggplot(data = data, aes(x = q4_1_s)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = sample_colours[1], col='grey66', binwidth=0.2)+
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,2))+ # truncate
  xlab('')+
  ylab('Count')+
  g.theme
plot_inset_staff = results$plot + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=9)) + # use smaller font to fit x-axis label
  annotation_custom(
    ggplotGrob(inset), 
    xmin = 5, xmax = 20, ymin = 20, ymax = 130
  )
plot_inset_staff
```

#### Students (average per month)

```{r}
n_resp = filter(data, !is.na(q4_1_p) | !is.na(q4_1_s)) %>% # for students or staff
  select(id) %>%
  unique() %>%
  nrow()
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q4_1_p", 
                     digits = 1,
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'continuous', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
# for text
text = sum(data$q4_1_p == 0, na.rm = TRUE)
percent = round(100*text/nrow(data))
```

There were `r text` (`r percent`%) respondents who said they had not provided any help to students.

##### Histogram

```{r}
# make an inset because of the strong skew in the plot
inset = ggplot(data = data, aes(x = q4_1_p)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = sample_colours[1], col='grey66', binwidth=0.2)+
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,2))+ # truncate
  xlab('')+
  ylab('Count')+
  g.theme
plot_inset_students = results$plot + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=9)) + # use smaller font to fit x-axis label
  annotation_custom(
    ggplotGrob(inset), 
    xmin = 5, xmax = 30, ymin = 20, ymax = 140
  )
plot_inset_students
```

We use an inset because the one outlier means most of the data is squashed in a narrow space.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# code for combined plot
plot_inset_staff = plot_inset_staff + ggtitle('Staff') + xlab('Average number per month')
plot_inset_students = plot_inset_students + ggtitle('Students')+ xlab('Average number per month')
jpeg('figures/advisors_help_numbers.jpg', width=7, height=5, units='in', res=500, quality=100)
grid.arrange(plot_inset_staff, plot_inset_students, ncol=2)
invisible(dev.off())
```

#### Average help

Here we estimate the amount of help provided to students and staff, and account for uncertainty from non-responders and the uncertainty indicated by some respondents, e.g. "2 to 4 times".

```{r}
source('4_help_with_uncertainty.R')

## make table
student_stats = calc_stats(indata = students, mult = 10) %>%
  mutate(group = 'Students')
staff_stats = calc_stats(indata = staff, mult = 10) %>%
  mutate(group = 'Staff')
table = bind_rows(student_stats, staff_stats) %>%
  select(group, statistic, mean, lower, upper)
ftab = flextable(table) %>%
  merge_v(j=1) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

The table shows the estimated mean and median with the uncertainty (lower to upper 95% confidence interval). It also shows the estimated percent who have not helped staff or students.

### Times provided advice - answer option

The tables below show which of the four options was most often used by respondents to estimate their times providing advice. 

#### Staff

```{r}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = TRUE, # change to TRUE
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "q4_1_option_s", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
```

#### Students

```{r}

                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = TRUE, 
                     label = "q4_1_option_p", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
```


## _Have you provided advice about_

```{r}
# only for those who provided some advice
to_table = mutate(data, any_advice == TRUE)
n_resp = length(unique(to_table$id)) # number of respondents to this question
#
results = make_table_matrix(indata = to_table, 
                            inlabels = labels, 
                            ordered = FALSE, 
                            ordered_row = 'Yes', 
                            legend = c('Yes','No'),

# Demographics

## _Approximately how many years have you worked in research?_

text = sum(data$q5_2 == '0 years (I am not a researcher)', na.rm = TRUE)
```

Almost all of the advisors were senior researchers. 

RIAs are supposed to have research experience, so the `r text` respondents who are not researchers may be not be aligned with the policy, however, they might still provide good advice.

# Survey response results

In this section we examine meta-data on the survey including the completeness and time taken.


## Numbers not eligible, withdrawn and out-of-office

```{r}
## make counts
# out of office
out_of_office = filter(admin_data, str_detect(response, 'Out of office')) %>%
  select(email) %>%
  unique() %>% # remove those who were away for both
  nrow()
# not eligible
not_eligible = filter(admin_data, response == 'Not eligible') %>%
  nrow()
# out of office
withdrew = filter(admin_data, response == 'withdrawn') %>%
  nrow()
# bounced
bounced = filter(admin_data, response == 'Bounced') %>%
  nrow()
```

There were `r out_of_office` out-of-office emails and `r bounced` emails bounced as the address was no longer valid. The number who withdrew was `r withdrew`. The number not eligible was `r not_eligible`.

## Response dates

```{r}
# bar plot
bar = ggplot(data=data, aes(x = start_date))+
  geom_bar(position='stack', fill=bar_colours[1], col='grey66')+
  g.theme +
  xlab('')+
  ylab('Frequency')
bar
```

The survey was launched on Monday 13 February 2023. Reminders were sent 2 weeks later (27 February) to non-responders and incomplete responders. The survey was closed on 13 March.

## Questionnaire progress as a percent

The table below shows the questionnaire progress as a percent, with the results grouped into three categories.

```{r}
#
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours, 
                     label = "progress_cat", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical')
results$table
```

Most respondents completed most of the questions.

## Time taken

Time taken in minutes to complete the questions. 

```{r}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     digits = 0, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours,
                   label = "duration_in_mins", 
                   ltype='question', 
                   type='continuous')
results$table
```

The survey did not take long to complete.

## Numerical summary of optional text comments

```{r}
# find all the comments:
text = dplyr::select(data, all_of(comment_questions)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=starts_with('q')) %>%
  filter(!is.na(value))
n_comments = nrow(text) # count the number of comments
text = mutate(text, nchar = nchar(value),
         nwords = lengths(gregexpr("\\W+", value)) + 1) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(n=n(), median = round(median(nwords))) %>% # number and length of comments
  mutate(cell = paste(n, ' / ', median, sep='')) %>%
  dplyr::select(-n, -median) %>%
  left_join(labels, by=c('name' = 'names')) %>%
  mutate(
    section = str_remove_all(name, '^q|_.'),
    labels = str_remove_all(labels, ' \\(Optional\\)')) %>%
  dplyr::select(labels, 'cell') %>%
  rename('question' = 'labels',
         'Number of comments / median words' = 'cell')
# table
ftab = flextable(text) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  width(j=1, width=4) %>%
  width(j=2, width=2)
ftab
```

The table shows the number of comments and the median number of words.

The total number of comments was `r n_comments`.

## Did they provide their email for further study?

```{r email}
results = make_table(indata = data, 
                     inlabels = labels, 
                     ordered = FALSE, 
                     include.missing = FALSE, 
                     label = "email_provided", 
                     ltype = 'question', 
                     type = 'categorical', 
                     sample_colours = sample_colours)
results$table
```

Respondents were asked about their interest to take part in a further qualitative study about their role as a Research Integrity Advisor. 

## Missing data

This section examines the item-missing data of missing responses to each question. The plot below shows what responses were missing (shown in grey), excluding optional comments. The questions are ordered according to the survey.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# remove variables that can't be missing 
for_visdat = dplyr::select(data, any_advice, starts_with('q')) %>%
  dplyr::select(!all_of(comment_questions)) %>% # remove comments
  dplyr::select(any_advice, starts_with('q2'), starts_with('q3'), starts_with('q4'), starts_with('q5')) %>% # ordering to match survey
  dplyr::select(-'q3_3_option', -contains('uncertainty'), -contains('option'), # remove generated variables
     -contains('lower'), -contains('upper'), # remove uncertainty bounds
     -contains('_text'), # remove optional "Other"
     -'q2_3_1', -'q2_3_2', # are conditional on q2_2
     -'q4_2_15', # other option
     -'q5_1_9', # other option
     -contains('_do_')) # remove random ordering variables

## separate panels for those who did not provide any advice
for_visdat1 = filter(for_visdat, any_advice == TRUE) %>%
  select(-'any_advice')
for_visdat2 = filter(for_visdat, any_advice == FALSE) %>%
  select(-'any_advice', -starts_with('q4_2'), -starts_with('q4_3')) # remove questions only for those who gave advice

# now make plots
plot1 = vis_dat(for_visdat1, sort_type = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom',
        plot.title = element_text(margin = margin(0,0,-10,0))) + # reduce space between title and plot
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  ylab('Respondent')+
  ggtitle('Have provided advice')
glegend = g_legend(plot1) # get legend ... 
plot1 = plot1 + theme(legend.position = 'none')  # ... now turn off legend
plot2 = vis_dat(for_visdat2, sort_type = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none',
        plot.title = element_text(margin = margin(0,0,-10,0))) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  ylab('Respondent')+
  ggtitle('Have not provided advice')
#
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
grid.arrange(grobs=list(plot1, plot2, glegend), ncol=1, heights=c(1,1,0.1), main='')
# export
jpeg('figures/missing.jpg', width=5, height=6, units='in', res=500, quality=100)
grid.arrange(grobs = list(plot1, plot2, glegend), ncol=1, heights=c(1,1,0.1))
invisible(dev.off())
```


### Counts of missing data by question

```{r}
# separate numbers for those who did and did not give advice
c1 = miss_var_summary(for_visdat1) %>%
  mutate(N = nrow(for_visdat1))
c2 = miss_var_summary(for_visdat2) %>%
  mutate(N = nrow(for_visdat2))
# combine numbers 
nums = bind_rows(c1, c2) %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  summarise(nmiss = sum(n_miss),
            n = sum(N)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(pct_miss = 100*nmiss/n) %>%
  arrange(pct_miss, nmiss)
#
table = left_join(nums, labels, by=c('variable' = 'names')) %>% # add question labels
  dplyr::select(labels, everything(), -variable) %>%
#  mutate( # tidy up labels
  rename(
    'Question' = 'labels', 
    'Maximum possible' = 'n',
    'Number missing' = 'nmiss',
    'Percent missing' = 'pct_miss') 

# make table
ftab = flextable(table) %>%
  fontsize(size=9, part='all') %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  width(j=1, width=5) %>%
  colformat_double(j=4, digits=0)
ftab
```

The table rows are ordered by the variables with the most to least amount of missing.
Most questions were reasonably well completed. 

The question with the most amount of missing was the month they started in the role, which they were instructed to leave blank if they were unsure. Some of the questions on what advice they provided were also often blank, including Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and Sexual harassment. 


```{r, include=FALSE}
# save results for plotting
#save(research_area_plot_random, research_area_plot_nonrandom,
#     gender_plot_random, gender_plot_nonrandom,
#     years_plot_random, years_plot_nonrandom, 
#     boxplot_grant, 
#     how_often_plot_random, how_often_plot_nonrandom,
#     aware_plot_random, aware_plot_nonrandom,
#     understand_plot_random, understand_plot_nonrandom,
#     write_anything_plot_random, write_anything_plot_nonrandom,
#     panel_plot_random, panel_plot_nonrandom,
#     comfort_plot_random, comfort_plot_nonrandom,
#     time_adjustment_plot,
#     dplot, scatter, # difference for peer reviewers,
#     file='results/plots.RData')
```

## Response randomisation

To reduce potential bias from response ordering, we randomised the order of response categories where possible. For example, the question on whether advisors thought they could help, was sometimes presented as "All to the time" to "None of the time", and at other times presenting  in the reverse order. Here we test whether this ordering influenced the responses.

```{r, include=FALSE}
## 1. amount of training
exists = length(dir('results', pattern='random_latent_training'))>0
if(exists == FALSE){
  source('4_latent_models_training.R')
}
if(exists == TRUE){
  load('results/4_random_latent_training.RData')
}
res1 = filter(to_table, rowname == 'order') %>%
  mutate(outcome = 'Training')

# 2. have they helped?
exists = length(dir('results', pattern='random_latent_help'))>0
if(exists == FALSE){
  source('4_latent_models_help.R')
}
if(exists == TRUE){
  load('results/4_random_latent_help.RData')
}
res2 = filter(to_table, rowname == 'order') %>%
  mutate(outcome = 'Helped')

# make joint table
to_table = bind_rows(res1, res2) %>%
  mutate(Mean = exp(mean),
         lower = exp(lower),
         upper = exp(upper),
         Mean = round(Mean*100)/100,
         lower = round(lower*100)/100,
         upper = round(upper*100)/100,
         CI = paste(lower, ' to ', upper, sep='')) %>%
  select(outcome, Mean, CI)
```

```{r}
ftab = flextable(to_table) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  autofit()
ftab
```

The table shows the odds ratios and 95% credible interval for the association between the randomised order the responses, and the probability of giving a more positive response. There is no strong association, indicating that respondents were not simply ticking the first or last responses.
